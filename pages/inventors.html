                        Nikola Tesla is often called the "father of energy" or "father of modern electricity". 
                        He was a Serbian-born American inventor, engineer, and futurist who pioneered the alternating current (AC) 
                        electrical supply system. His work laid the foundation for the electricity generation and delivery systems that are used today.

                        Alexander Graham Bell is best known for being the primary inventor of the telephone. 
                        He founded Bell Telephone Company in 1877 and then went to work on other inventions, including flying machines. 
                        In addition to his inventions, Bell is known for establishing the scientific facilities Volta Laboratory, 
                            the American Association to Promote Teaching of Speech to the Deaf, and Science magazine.

                                Often called “The Father of Computing,” Babbage detailed plans for mechanical Calculating Engines, 
                                Difference Engines, and Analytical Engines. Babbage died on October 18, 1871, 
                                in London.</p>

                        Arguably one of the most famous inventors of all time, 
                                Thomas Edison is credited with inventing the first commercially viable incandescent lightbulb. 
                                But this was just one of his many inventions. He’s also the inventor of the Universal Stock Printer, 
                                which was used to synchronize stock tickers’ transactions, the quadruplex telegraph, and the phonograph, among others. 
                                During his lifetime, he was granted more than 1,000 U.S. patents for various inventions.

                                Although much of his career was spent in legal battles regarding his invention, 
                                he eventually accepted a deal from RCA, allowing them to market and sell the first electronic televisions 
                                for home consumers. In addition to the television, he worked on technologies including radar, infrared telescopes, 
                                and nuclear fusion.

                        Herman Hollerith is the father of modern machine data processing. 
                                His invention of the punched card machine marked the beginning of the automatic data processing age. 
                                Whereas punched cards had previously been used to control looms, Hollerith now used them to store data.

                        Along with Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs was an inventor behind Apple Computers. 
                                As the now-famous story goes, Jobs and Wozniak started Apple Computers in Jobs’ family’s garage in 1976, 
                                and the work they did there made computers more accessible and more affordable for consumers. 
                                Jobs left Apple in 1985, but he returned in 1997 and revitalized the company, 
                                leading to the creation of products like the iPod and iPhone.

                        Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin, 
                        a device that could take green-seed cotton and quickly extract the fibers using a system of hooks, wires, 
                        and a rotating brush. The device was so popular that farmers began building their own versions of it despite Whitney’s patent. 
                        He spent years in legal battles and ultimately made very little profit, despite the revolutionary nature of his invention.</p>
